/**
 * MainCoroutineRule is used only in tests and it has the same synchronous execution behavior found in runBlocking.
 * However, MainCoroutineRule has more specialized testing features not found in runBlocking such as control flow management.
 * In addition, using MainCoroutineRule will significantly make your testing code cleaner.
 * In a much more detailed manner, MainCoroutineRule is directly related to JUnit Rule.
 * If you have used JUnit before, you might remember filling out @Before @After to provide a testing environment for the test cases. If you have multiple test cases,
 * you would eventually have to write multiple @Before @After to provide multiple testing environments, which could possibly lead to redundant boilerplate code. Now,
 * this is where MainCoroutineRule shines! With MainCoroutineRule you can declare a testing environment once and reuse them for multiple test cases.

/**
 * Rules
 * JUnit rules are classes where you can define generic testing code that can execute before, after, or during a testâ€“-it's a way to take your code that would have been in
 * @Before and @After, and put it in a class where it can be reused.
